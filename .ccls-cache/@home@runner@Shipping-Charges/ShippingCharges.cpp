File Name: ShippingCharges.cpp
Programmer: Kason Steiner
Date: 10/2024

Write a program that asks for the weight of the package and the distance
it is to be shipped, then displays the charges. Do not accept values of 0 or less for the weight of the package. Do not accept weights of more than 20 kg (this is the maximum weight the company will ship). Do not accept distances of less than 10 miles or more than 3,000 miles. These are the company's minimum and maximum shipping distances.
